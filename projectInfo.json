Its a webapp, which allows users to play Dungeons and Dragons with an AI dungeon-master, which keeps track of everything, while sculpting a story. Players are able to interract however they like by just typing to the Dungeon Master, but we also added quality of life quick actions, as well as environmental effects on screen depending on where they are in game."

It‚Äôs inspiration began from the Stream deck, a device used by streamers that acts as a visual way to interact with shortcuts on your computer. Rather than having to memorize every possible computer shortcut or buy an expensive device such as the stream deck, Dequeue allows you to display and quickly access shortcuts right on your phone. Dequeue was build using React Native for the mobile phone app and Electron for the desktop app, allowing it to run on numerous platforms with ease. All data is stored locally on the computer and transmitted back and forth via LAN to the phone."
