		"description": "Dequeue is an app that allows you to control your computer from your phone, made by myself and Ayden Colby! It has a home screen allowing you to control more general things like volume, music, or terminal commands, and a section which allows you to create your own shortcuts and scripts to run on your computer remotely. This is my first time working with a mobile centric design and my first time using progressive web apps.",
